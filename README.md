# RCV League Observer Tool Stream Deck Plugin

This plugin allows control of the [League Observer Tool](https://github.com/RCVolus/league-observer-tool) (and by extension, the League Spectator Client) directly through your Stream Deck.

## Functionality
- Set up UI for Observing: Shows/hides the necessary League Spectator UI for normal game spectating (use after loading into the game or after playing cinematics)
- Set up UI for Cinematics: Hides all UI, Champion/Structure healthbars for cinematics
- Sync to first Operator: Syncs the ingame time with the primary observer (use to get back into sync after showing replays)
